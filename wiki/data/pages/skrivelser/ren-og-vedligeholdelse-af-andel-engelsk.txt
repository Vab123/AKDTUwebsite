Dear owner and/or resident,

According to our statutes §10, it is the duty of the owner to ensure prober cleaning and maintenance of his/her apartment including the terrace/balcony.

The purpose of this letter is to draw attention to what you must do.

To give the best overview, the tasks are divided into three categories; General, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter.

By performing these simple maintenance tasks, we ensure a property that not only looks nicer, but also has a longer life.

This helps increase the marketability of the apartments and lowers the risk of costly repairs that may affect the monthly rent.

Lack of maintenance and cleaning will also result in a reduction in value by the assessor when selling the apartment.

Cleaning and maintenance must be carried out no later than 4/8 2019. If it is not carried out, the Board will impose the owner a fee for the missing work – The fee will be charged as part of the monthly charge.

Note that even if you receive a fee, the work still needs to be done.

In the event of a serious and/or repeated neglect of the duty to clean and maintain, the Board may exclude owners from their apartment.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact the board at [[bestyrelsen@akdtu.dk]].

Yours sincerely,\\
The board\\

====General====
  * Terraces/balconies and front door must not be used as storage space.

  * Damages/defects of the buildings (incl. In apartments) that may be of importance to the operation must be reported to the board as soon as possible.
    * This can e.g. be leaks on water or heating pipes og penetrating water thorigh doors/windows.
    * **Note**: Clogged drains/pipes are your own responsibility.

**Spring/Summer**
  * Ground Floor

    * Maintain the floor on the balcony.
      - The floor must be cleaned thoroughly so that it is completely clean of dirt and algae.
      - When the floor is clean and dry, apply thin layers of linseed oil (in Danish: Linolie) – preferably with fungicide.
        * Each layer must be dry before aplying a new layer.
        * Linseed oil can be found in the closet in the depot room in the common house; if there are no more left, contact the board.
        * Due to several years of lack of maintenance among many owners/residents, the floor may need more layers than normally – 10 layers are not unthinkable. This needs to be done over a longer period of time so that it can penetrate properly and harden.
        * **Note**: Linseed oil is self-igniting, which means that if you use a cloth to apply the oil, it must be disposed of in a responsible manner.
